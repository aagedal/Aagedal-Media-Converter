# Aagedal Media Converter

A lightweight minimal macOS application for simple batch encoding of video files. Powered by FFMPEG and FFPROBE under the hood and written entirely in Swift / SwiftUI.

Removes almost all metdata by default. Fully private local only processing.

Note that most of this app is vibe-coded.

## Key Features

- **Drag-and-Drop** or File Picker import
- Batch conversion with per-file progress and overall dock progress indicator
- Watch Folder, with optional auto-delete after a set time.
- **Export Presets**  
  • Video Loop (silent) — x264 very slow 1080p max resolution, keeping original aspect ratio, removing all audio channels, nice for compact web distribution such as GIF-replacements, slow export
  
  • Video Loop w/ Audio — same as above but keeping a stereo AAC track

  • TV Quality HD / 4K — HEVC hardware encoding for fast high quality exports, compatible with most editing software, 10-bit 4:2:0, limit resolution to either 1080p or 2160p

  • ProRes — High quality file maintaining original resolution

  • Animated AVIF — Another GIF-alternative without sound. Doesn't need special web-code to loop, but less hardware and software compatibility than VideoLoops

  • HEVC Proxy 1080p — Compact proxy file format, 10-bit 4:2:0, can be used fast file sharing

  • Audio Only AAC — Extract a small stereo audio file from video

  • Audio Only WAV — Extract uncompressed audio from video, keeping all audio channels

  • 3 Custom FFMPEG presets, which can be named.
  
- Set default preset in the settings menu
- Set default export location
- Add metadata comment with optional date tag (YYYYMMDD)
- Drag to rearrange encoding queue
- Warning if file already exists
- Draggable icon on encoded files, making it possible to open the new file directly in another app to copy to a new directory. (Useful for fast sharing to Slack or Web-services)
- Icon to open the file in the export directory
- Thumbnail preview with checkerboard background to clearly see original aspect ratio
- Automatic duration warning if a VideoLoop clip exceeds 15s (short videos are best for auto-playing and looping on webpages)
- Sandboxed with Security-Scoped Bookmarks for persistent file access
- Auto remove spaces and special characters. æ, ø, å is replaced with ae, o and aa.
- Language support: English and Norwegian

## Requirements

|                | Minimum |
|----------------|---------|
| macOS          | 15.0 (Sequoia) or later |
| Hardware       | Apple Silicon (M1 or later) |


## Building & Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Aagedal-VideoLoop-Converter-2.0.git
   cd Aagedal-VideoLoop-Converter-2.0
   ```
2. Open `Aagedal VideoLoop Converter 2.0.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Select the *Aagedal VideoLoop Converter 2.0* scheme and **Run** (⌘R).

> The project uses Swift Strict Concurrency (`complete`) and upcoming language features—Xcode 16 is required.

---

## Usage

1. Launch the app.
2. Drag video files onto the window **or** click the plus button to import files.
3. Select an **Export Preset** from the toolbar menu.
4. Hit the green *Convert* button or press ⌘⏎.

### 15-Second Autoplay Warning

Web browsers often refuse to autoplay long, looping videos with sound. The app shows a yellow ⚠️ icon when the VideoLoop presets are applied to clips longer than 15 seconds, encouraging you to trim the video or pick another preset.

### App Intents

Not tested with macOS 26 Tahoe, but in macOS 15 you have two available App Shortcuts available in the macOS Shortcuts app:
1. Add to Encode Cue
2. Convert Video Immediately (using the default VideoLoop-preset).

## Known issues
- Unable to render thumbnails for some MXF-files, this does not affect conversion. (Likely the FFMPEG thumbnail generation fallback is not working as intended. Other thumbnails generated by native macOS APIs IIRC.)

---
## Work in progress
1. Preview and trim files. Status: Currently Apple native formats are working, but I want to implement support for all FFMPEG-supported formats before releasing.
2. Grab screenshots at source resolution. (JPEG for SDR, AVIF for HDR, 16-bit PNG for ProRes RAW.) Status: Working, though capture seems a bit slow.
3. Metadata info view. Status: Done, but I may need to add more metadata-fields in the future.
4. Fixed import of webm, and other file extensions that I forgot ti add to the supported file extensions list. Status: done.
5. Optimizing list scrolling performance when many files are queued.

## Future ideas
1. Per item settings
2. Merge/combine queue items into single file
3. Audio waveform visualization option when no video stream is available. (This would also imply adding support for audio file input).
4. Add more app intents.
5. Refactoring... The code is getting messy, making iterations slower and more complex. #procastination


Note that this is a sparetime project. I this is a passion project I don't get paid for.

PS! This app was previously called Aagedal VideoLoop Converter. Aagedal Media Converter is the same app, just with a new name that better reflects what it has become.
